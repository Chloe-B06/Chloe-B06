👋 Hi, I’m @Chloe-B06

👀 I’m interested in using data to improve animal health and veterinary practices.

🌱 I’m currently learning Python, machine learning, and data science, with a focus on animal care applications.

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that apply data science to the veterinary field.
